Boolean expression simplification

Relationship between hardware and software

How arithmetic and control units work internally

Core concepts used in CPU, memory, and ALU design

🌍 Real-World Applications

Adders → Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

Flip-Flops → Memory elements

Counters → Timers, clocks, and processors

Multiplexers → Data routing in CPUs

🚀 Why This Repository Matters
